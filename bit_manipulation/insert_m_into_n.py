"""
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at
bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all
of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits
between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could
fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2
