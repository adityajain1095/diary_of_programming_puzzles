"""
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly 
linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

A: a1 -> a2 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3
B: b1 -> b2 -> b3 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3

begin to intersect at node c1.

Notes:
* If two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
