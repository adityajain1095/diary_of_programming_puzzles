"""
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return 
its head.

For example,
Given the linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 
1->2->3->5.

Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass
