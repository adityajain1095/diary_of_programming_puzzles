"""
Implement a routine that prints all possible orderings of the characters in a 
string. In other words, print all permutations that use all the characters 
from the original string. 

For example, given the string "hat", your function should 
print the strings "tha", "aht", "tah", "ath", "hta", and "hat". Treat each 
character in the input string as a distinct character, even if it is repeated. 
Given the string "aaa", your routine should print "aaa" six times. You may print 
the permutations in any order you choose.
